### Let's Start From Scratch

Hello everybody, I have decided to start from scratch. This is because in my previous attempts, I didn't get a much contributions. Now, in this account, I will add repositories that are useful.
Feel free to comment. Also, I don't copy code from websites. My work in this account will be genuine.

### Who am I?

I am actually learning code right now. In my previous account, I made repositories for learning. But in this account, I will be making repositories for my masterpieces. Also I will be hosting the repositories on firebase as well. Be sure to check the links.
